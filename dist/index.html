        Coventry began as a small settlement around a Saxon convent in the <strong> 7th century. It grew noticeably after <em> Leofric, Earl of Mercia, and Lady Godiva founded a Benedictine monastery in 1043 (yes, that Lady Godiva) </em>.</strong> By the Middle Ages, Coventry was one of England’s most important cities, thriving on the cloth and textile trade. It became a royal city and briefly served as the seat of government in the 15th century. 18th–19th centuries, Coventry reinvented itself as an industrial hub, first for silk weaving, then bicycles, and eventually motor cars—earning a major role in Britain’s automotive industry. The city was heavily bombed during the Coventry Blitz in 1940. The destruction of the medieval cathedral became a powerful symbol of wartime devastation. Coventry was rebuilt with modern architecture and a strong message of reconciliation and peace. <strong> Today it’s a diverse city known for manufacturing, culture, and education, and was named UK City of Culture in 2021. </strong></p>
